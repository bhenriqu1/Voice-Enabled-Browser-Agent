Voice-Enabled Browser Agent
Voice-enabled browser automation agent that listens to natural speech, 
converts it into structured commands, and executes them inside a real browser session. 
System leverages speech-to-text for transcription, an intent parser to transform 
spoken language into structured JSON instructions, and Browserbase for reliable headless browser automation.

Assistant supports multi-step workflows such as searching, 
filtering, navigating, filling forms, extracting data, and summarizing results, 
while maintaining context across turns. Responses should be returned via text-to-speech and 
accompanied by screenshots or extracted results for transparency.
